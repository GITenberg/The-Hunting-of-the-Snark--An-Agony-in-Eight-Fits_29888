description: (Publishers Description) "Oliver Twist's famous cry of the heart--"Please,
  sir, I want some more"--has resounded with generations of readers of all ages. The
  author poured his own youthful experience of Victorian London's unspeakable squalor
  into this realistic depiction of a spirited young innocent's unwilling but inevitable
  recruitment into a scabrous gang of thieves. Masterminded by the loathsome Fagin,
  the underworld crew features some of Dickens' most memorable characters, including
  the vicious Bill Sikes, gentle Nancy, and the juvenile pickpocket known as the Artful
  Dodger." (Major British Writers, Peter Schenck Class)
